# Experimental Data Analysis with R for Electrical Circuits

This repository contains code written in R for circuit analysis and data processing. The code is specifically geared towards extracting experimental data from electrical circuits, such as amperage, voltage, etc., and then processing it using the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in R. The resulting data is then modeled and visualized in order to write a laboratory report.

**The code in this repository follows the 'snake case' naming convention.**

## Getting Started

In order to use this repository, you will need to have R installed on your machine. Additionally, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of circuit analysis and data processing using R.
